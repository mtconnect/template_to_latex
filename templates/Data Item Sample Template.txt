|@PATH_POSITION@&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;|A measured or calculated position of a control point associated with a @Controller@ element, or @Path@ element if provided, of a piece of equipment.@
@
The control point *MUST* be reported as a set of space-delimited floating-point numbers representing a point in 3-D space. The position of the control point *MUST* be reported in units of @MILLIMETER@ and listed in order of X, Y, and Z referenced to the coordinate system of the piece of equipment.@
@
Any control point representing a position in 1-D or 2-D space *MAY* be represented in terms of 3-D space by setting any undefined coordinate to zero (0).@
@
@PATH_POSITIONO@ *SHOULD* be further defined with a @coordinateSytem@ attribute. If a coordinateSystem attribute is not specified, the position of the control point *MUST* be reported in @WORK@ coordinates.|MILLIMETER_3D|
|>.@ACTUAL@|The measured position of the current program control point as reported by the piece of equipment.| MILLIMETER_3D|
|>.@COMMANDED@|The position computed by the @Controller@ type component| MILLIMETER_3D|
|>.@TARGET@|The desired end position for a movement or a series of movements. Multiple discrete movements may need to be completed to achieve the final _target_ position| MILLIMETER_3D|

|_.DataItem Type|_.Element Name|_.Description|
|@PATH_POSITION@|@PathPosition@|A measured or calculated position of a control point reported by the @Controller@ element of a piece of equipment expressed in @WORK@ coordinates. The coordinate system will revert to @MACHINE@ coordinates if @WORK@ coordinates are not available.@
@
Subtypes of PathPosition are @ACTUAL@, @PROGRAMMED@, @COMMANDED@, @TARGET@, and @PROBE@.@
@
If a @subType@ is not specified, the reported value for the data *MUST* default to the subtype of @ACTUAL@.@
@
PathPosition *MUST* be reported as a set of space-delimited floating-point numbers representing a point in 3-D space. The position of the control point *MUST* be reported in units of @MILLIMETER@ and listed in order of X, Y, and Z referenced to the coordinate system of the piece of equipment.
An example of the value reported for PathPosition would be:
<pre><PathPosition ...>10.123 55.232 100.981 </PathPosition></pre>
Where X = 10.123, Y = 55.232, and Z=100.981.|

<pre>
  <PathPosition ... >10.123 55.232 100.981</PathPosition>

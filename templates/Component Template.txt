h1. @Linear@

h2. Parent: @Axes@ _(unless this is a top-level component)_

A @Linear@ axis represents the movement of a physical piece of equipment, or a portion of the equipment, in a straight line.  

Movement may be either in a positive or negative direction.  

@Linear@ type @Axes@ *MUST* be identified using a value for the name attribute as X, Y, or Z with 
numbers appended for additional axes in the same plane.  Additional linear axes are often referred to as U, V, and W.   
However, MTConnect defines the secondary axes to X, Y, and Z as X2, Y2, and Z2.

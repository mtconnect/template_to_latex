Would also suggest adding a three space path orientation that would consist of the A, B, and C angles relative to the reference frame.

|@ORIENTATION@&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;|A measured or calculated orientation of a plane or vector relative to a cartesian coordinate system. 
@Orientation@ *MUST* be reported as a set of space-delimited floating-point numbers and *MUST* be reported in units of @DEGREE_3D@ that is an ordered set of values representing the degrees of rotation around the  @X@, @Y@, and @Z@ axes of a coordinate system (@A@, @B@, @C@).@
@
Any orientation representing a vector or plane in 2-D space *MAY* be represented in terms of 3-D space by setting any undefined coordinate to zero (0). @
@
@ORIENTATION@ *SHOULD* be further defined with a coordinateSytem attribute.  If a coordinateSystem attribute is not specified, the position of the control point *MUST* be reported in *WORK* coordinates. |@DEGREE_3D@|

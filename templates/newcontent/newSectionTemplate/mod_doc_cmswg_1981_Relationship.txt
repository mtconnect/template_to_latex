@Relationship@ is an XML element that describes the association between two pieces of equipment that function independently but together perform a manufacturing operation. @Relationship@ may also be used to define the association between two components within a piece of equipment.@
@
@Relationship@ is an abstract type XML element, @Relationship@ will be replaced in the XML document by specific @Relationship@ types.  XML elements representing @Relationship@ are described in {section:DeviceRelationship} and {section:ComponentRelationship}.@ 
@
A separate @Relationship@ type element *MAY* be defined to describe each pair of associations with a piece of equipment or between @Component@ elements within a piece of equipment.  Pieces of equipment may only be affiliated with other pieces of equipment and @Component@ elements may only be affiliated with other @Component@ elements within a specific piece of equipment.@
@
The current supported types of @Relationship@ are @DeviceRelationship@ and @ComponentRelationship@.@

@Relationships@ is an XML container that organizes information defining the affiliation between pieces of equipment that function independently but together perform a manufacturing operation.  @Relationships@ may also define the affiliation between components within a piece of equipment.@
@ 
@Relationships@ may be modeled as part of a @Device@ or a @Component@ _Structural Element_.@
@ 
@Relationships@ contains one or more @Relationship@ XML elements.@

* Part : Part 2

h2. Parent: @Structural Elements for MTConnectDevices@ _(Parent Section if any)_

@Relationship@ is an XML element that describes the association between two pieces of equipment that function independently but together perform a manufacturing operation. @Relationship@ may also be used to define the association between two components within a piece of equipment.@
@
@Relationship@ is an abstract type XML element, @Relationship@ will be replaced in the XML document by specific @Relationship@ types.  XML elements representing @Relationship@ are described in _Sections 4.10.1 and Section 4.10.2_.@ 
@
A separate @Relationship@ type element *MAY* be defined to describe each pair of associations with a piece of equipment or between @Component@ elements within a piece of equipment.  Pieces of equipment may only be affiliated with other pieces of equipment and @Component@ elements may only be affiliated with other @Component@ elements within a specific piece of equipment.@
@
The current supported types of @Relationship@ are @DeviceRelationship@ and @ComponentRelationship@.@ 
@
The XML schema in {ref:relationship-schema-diagram} represents the structure of the @Relationship@ XML element.@

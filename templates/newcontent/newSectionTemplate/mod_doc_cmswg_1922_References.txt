* Part : Part 1

h2. Parent: @MTConnect Request/Response Information Exchange Implemented with HTTP@

A _Structural Element_ *MAY* include a set of _References_ of the following types that *MAY* alter the content of the _Current Request_ and _Sample Request_ _Response Documents_ as specified:

* A _Component_ _Reference_ (@ComponentRef@) modifies the set of resulting _Data Entities_, limited by a path query parameter of a _Current Request_ or _Sample Request_, to include the _Data Entities_ associated with the _Structural Element_ whose value for its @id@ attribute matches the value provided for the @idRef@ attribute of the @ComponentRef@ element. Additionally, _Data Entities_ defined for any _Lower Level_ _Structural Element_(s) associated with the identified _Structural Element_ *MUST* also be returned. The result is equivalent to appending //[@id@=<"idRef">] to the path query parameters of the _Current Request_ or _Sample Request_. See _Section 8.3.2 in Part 1.0, Overview and Fundamentals_ for more details on path queries.

* A _Data Item_ _Reference_ (@DataItemRef@) modifies the set of resulting _Data Entities_, limited by a path query parameter of a _Current Request_ or _Sample Request_, to include the _Data Entity_ whose value for its @id@ attribute matches the value provided for the @idRef@ attribute of the @DataItemRef@ element. The result is equivalent to appending //[@id@=<"idRef">] to the path query parameters of the _Current Request_ or _Sample Request_. See _Section 8.3.2 in Part 1.0, Overview and Fundamentals_ for more details on path queries.

* Update Line: [[@Source@ is an optional XML element that identifies the physical part of a piece of equipment where the data represented by @DataItem@ originated.]]

@Source@ is an optional XML element that may be used to identify the physical part of a piece of equipment where the data represented by @DataItem@ originated and/or it may be used to identify a complex name or an alternate name used to identify the data where it originated (e.g. a PLC tag name).


* Update Line: [[In the case where the real name associated with a @DataItem@ element is either complex or does not meet the format requirements of a NMTOKEN XML type, the real name of the element may not be able to be expressed in the @name@ attribute. When this occurs, a short name or nickname can be used for the name attribute and the real name can be provided as the CDATA for @Source@.]]

In the case where the real name associated with a @DataItem@ element is either complex or does not meet the format requirements of a NMTOKEN XML type, the real name of the element may not be able to be expressed as the value of the @name@ attribute.  Additionally, a second or alternate name may be required to describe a piece of data.  An example of this case would be the identity of the bit address in a PLC that represents this piece of data (PLC address I0015.4).  When these cases occur, the alternate name can be provided as the value for the CDATA for @Source@.

h1. @Data Sets@

* Parent: @Storage of Streaming Data@
* Part: Part 1
* Add After Section: @Heartbeat@

An _Agent_ *MUST* maintain the current state of the _Data Set_ for every _Data Entity_ with a representation of _Data Set_ for all data associated with a _sequence number_ as described in {section:Management of Streaming Data Storage}.

_Data Entities_ represented as _Data Sets_ provides a facility for providing multiple values for a single _Data Entity_ where each entry in the _Data Set_ is a _key-value pair_ uniquely identified by the _key_. For more details on _Data Entities_ defined as _Data Sets_, see \citetitle{MTCPart2} _Section 7.2.2.12_ and \citetitle{MTCPart3} _Section 5.3.4_.

Any number of _key-value pairs_ may be added, removed or changed in a single update to the _Data Set_. An _Agent_ *MUST* publish the changes to one or more _key-value pairs_ as a single _Data Entity_ associated with a single _sequence number_. An _Agent_ *MUST* indicate the removal of a _key-value pair_ from a _Data Set_.

When the _Data Entity_ definition has the @discrete@ attribute set to @false@ or is not present, an _Agent_, when streaming data, *MUST* suppress identical successive _key-value pairs_ and only publish the _key-value pairs_ that have changed since the previous state of the _Data Set_.

When the _Data Entity_ definition has the @discrete@ attribute set to @true@, an _Agent_, when streaming data, *MUST* report all _key-value pairs_ regardless of the previous state of the _Data Set_, and *MUST NOT* suppressed any identical _key-value pairs_.

When a _reset_ occurs, the current state of the _Data Set_ *MUST* be cleared and contain no _key-value pairs_. The _Data Set_ *MAY* be simultaneously populated with a new set of _key-value pairs_. The previous entries *MUST NOT* be included and *MUST NOT* indicate removal. An _Agent_ *MUST NOT* suppress reporting any _key-value pairs_ regardless of the prior state of the _Data Set_.

When the _Data Entity_ is @UNAVAILABLE@ the _Data Set_ *MUST* be cleared and contain no _key-value pairs_. The prior state of the _Data Set_ *MUST* not be retained and the _Data Set_ *MUST* be repopulated when the data is available.

h1. @Changes to Element Names when representation attribute is used@

* Parent: @Element Names for Data Entities@
* Part: Part 3
* Update Line: [[@representation@ attribute of @TIME_SERIES@ or]]

@representation@ attribute of @TIME_SERIES@, @DATA_SET@, or 

* Add After Line: [[*MUST* be transformed to the _Element Name_ @PartCountDiscrete@.]]

Similarly, the @DataItem@ element @VARIABLE@ with a @representation@ attribute defined as @DATA_SET@ *MUST* be transformed to the _Element Name_ \cfont{VariableDataSet}.

h1. @Response for SAMPLE category DataItem Elements with a representation attribute of DATA_SET@

* Parent: @Sample Data Entities@
* Part: Part 3
* Add Before Section: @Valid Data Values for Sample@

@SAMPLE@ category @DataItem@ elements defined in the @MTConnectDevices@ document with a @representation@ attribute of @DATA_SET@ *MUST* be represented in the @MTConnectStreams@ document as @Sample@ XML Elements reported as a  _Data Set_ of _key-value pairs_. @DATA_SET@ provides the capability to report a set of related data values as a single _Data Entity_.

The @Sample@ XML Element acts as a container for @Entry@ elements to provide a _Data Set_ of _key-value pairs_ where each @key@ attribute of the @Entry@ *MUST* be unique and acts as the identity of the _key-value pair_. The CDATA of the @Entry@ element represents the value portion of the _key-value pair_ and has the same constraints as the _Data Entity_ type defined for the @DataItem@ @type@.

h2. @XML Schema Structure for SAMPLE when reporting Data Set data@

{figure:Sample Data Set Schema Diagram} represents the XML schema of a @Sample@ XML element that represents a @SAMPLE@ category @DataItem@ element defined in the @MTConnectDevices@ document with a @representation@ attribute of @DATA_SET@.

* Figure: @Sample Data Set Schema Diagram@

h2. @Attributes for SAMPLE when reporting Data Set data@

{table:Attributes for DataSet} defines the additional attribute provided for a @Sample@ XML element that represents a @SAMPLE@ category @DataItem@ element defined in the @MTConnectDevices@ document with a @representation@ attribute of @DATA_SET@.

* Table: @Attributes for DataSet@

|_.Attribute|_.Description|_.Occurrence|
|@count@|Represents the number of _key-value pairs_ represented as @Entry@ elements as the contents of the @Sample@ element.@
@
@count@ *MUST* be provided when the @representation@ attribute of the @DataItem@ element is @DATA_SET@.@
@
@count@ *MUST NOT* be provided when the @representation@ attribute is defined as @DISCRETE@, @TIME_SERIES@, or @VALUE@, or when it is not defined.|0..1|

h2. @Elements for SAMPLE when reporting Data Set data@

{table:Elements for DataSet} defines the elements provided for a @Sample@ XML element that represents a @SAMPLE@ category @DataItem@ element defined in the @MTConnectDevices@ document with a @representation@ attribute of @DATA_SET@. @Entry@ is the only child element that *MAY* be associated with a _Data Entity_ with a @representation@ attribute of @DATA_SET@. Each @Entry@ element represents a unique _key-value pair_. 

* Table: @Elements for DataSet@

|_.Element|_.Description|_.Occurrence|
|@Entry@|A XML element representing a _key-value pair_ published as part of a _Data Set_.|0..*|

h3. @XML Schema Structure for Entry Element for a Data Entity@

{figure:Entry Element Schema Diagram} represents the XML Schema structure for a @Entry@ XML element that represents the information published for a _key-value pair_. Any number of @Entry@ elements *MAY* be provided for a _Data Entity_ defined with a @representation@ attribute of @DATA_SET@. 

* Figure: @Entry Element Schema Diagram@

!entry-element-schema-diagram.png!

Note: The \cfont{VariableDataSet} element shown in the XML schema is an example that illustrates the schema for a _Data Entity_ element and its associated @Entry@ elements representing a _Data Set_.

The following example demonstrates how multiple _key-value pairs_, each defined by an @Entry@ element, are structured in a @MTConnectStreams@ document.

* Example: @Example of multiple key-value pairs Reported for a Data Entity@

<pre>
  <VariableDataSet timestamp="..." sequence="..." count="2">
    <Entry key="a101">100.21</Entry>
    <Entry key="a102">609</Entry>
    <Entry key="a103" removed="true" />
  </VariableDataSet>
</pre>

h3. @Attributes for Entry Element for a Data Entity@

The {table:Attributes for Entry} defines the attributes provided for a @Entry@ XML element. 

* Table: @Attributes for Entry@

|_.Attribute|_.Description|_.Occurrence|
|@key@|A unique identifier for each _key-value pair_.@
@
The value provided for @key@ *MUST* be unique in any given set of @Entry@ elements.@
@
The value provided for @key@ is *MUST* be a XML NMTOKEN type.|1|
|@removed@|A indicator defining whether a specific _key-value pair_ has been removed from the set of _key-value pairs_ associated with this _Data Set_.@
@
@removed@ is an XML Boolean type that *MUST* have a value of @true@ or @false@.@
@
@true@ indicates that the _key-value pair_ has been removed from the _Data Set_.@
@
@false@ indicates that the _key-value pair_ has not been removed from the _Data Set_.@
@
If not specified, the default value for @removed@ is @false@|0..1|

h1. @Valid Data Values for Sample@

* Parent: @Sample Data Entities@
* Part: Part 3
* Add Before Line: [[
Data values provided for a @Sample@]]


In the case of a @Sample@ element associated with a @SAMPLE@ category @DataItem@ element with a @representation@ attribute of @DATA_SET@, the data reported for each _key-value pair_ *MUST* be provided in the same format and units as specified by the @type@ attribute for the @DataItem@ element.

When an _Agent_ responds to a _Current Request_, the information returned in the @MTConnectStreams@ document for a _Data Entity_ defined to represent a _Data Set_ *MUST* include the full set of _key-value pairs_ that are valid for that _Data Entity_. If the _Current Request_ includes an @at@ _query parameter_, the _Agent_ *MUST* provide the set of _key-value pairs_ that are valid at the specified _sequence number_.

When an _Agent_ responds to a _Sample Request_, the information returned in the @MTConnectStreams@ document for a _Data Entity_ defined to represent a _Data Set_ *MUST* include only those _key-value pairs_ that are valid for the _Data Entity_ at each _sequence number_. 


h1. @Response for Event category DataItem Elements with a representation attribute of DATA_SET@

* Parent: @Event Data Entities@
* Part: Part 3
* Add Before Section: @Response for EVENT category Data Items with a type attribute of MESSAGE@

The behavior of @EVENT@ category @DataItem@ elements defined in the @MTConnectDevices@ document with a @representation@ attribute of @DATA_SET@ function exactly the same as @SAMPLE@ category @DataItem@ elements with a @representation@ attribute of @DATA_SET@. Refer to {section:Response for SAMPLE category DataItem Elements with a representation attribute of DATA_SET} for details on @DataItem@ elements with a @representation@ attribute of @DATA_SET@.

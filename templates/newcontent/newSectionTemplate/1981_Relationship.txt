* Part : Part 2

h2. Parent: @Structural Elements for MTConnectDevices@

@Relationship@ is an XML element that describes the affiliation between two pieces of equipment that function independently but together perform a manufacturing operation. @Relationship@ may also be used to define the affiliation between two components within a piece of equipment.

A separate @Relationship@ element *MAY* be defined to describe each pair of affiliations associated with a piece of equipment or between @Component@ elements within a piece of equipment.  Pieces of equipment may only be affiliated with other pieces of equipment and @Component@ elements may only be affiliated with other @Component@ elements within a specific piece of equipment.

{ref:relationship-schema-diagram} describes the XML schema describing the structure of a @Relationship@ XML element.

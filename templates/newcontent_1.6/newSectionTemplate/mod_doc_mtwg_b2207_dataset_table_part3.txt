A @representation@ specifies the format and structure of the information for an _observation_. The default @representation@ is @VALUE@ indicating the format as specified in {cite:Part 3}.

A @representation@, other than @VALUE@, will modify the _Element Name_ of the _observation_ by appending the pascal case of the @representation@ as follows:

* Itemized List:

- A @DataItem@ with @type@ @TEMPERATURE@ and @representation@ of @TIME_SERIES@ becomes @TemperatureTimeSeries@

- *DEPRECATED* A @DataItem@ with @type@ @PART_COUNT@ and @representation@ of @DISCRETE@ becomes @PartCountDiscrete@

- A @DataItem@ with @type@ @VARIABLE@ and @representation@ of @DATA_SET@ becomes @VariableDataSet@

- A @DataItem@ with @type@ @WORK_OFFSET@ and @representation@ of @TABLE@ becomes @WorkOffsetTable@

* End List

The following constraints apply to each @representation@:

* Itemized List:

- A @DataItem@ with @representation@ @TIME_SERIES@ *MUST* have a @category@ @SAMPLE@

- *DEPRECATED* A @DataItem@ with @representation@ @DISCRETE@ *MUST* have a @category@ @EVENT@

- A @DataItem@ with @representation@ @DATA_SET@ *MUST* have a @category@ @EVENT@ or @SAMPLE@

- A @DataItem@ with @representation@ @TABLE@ *MUST* have a @category@ @EVENT@ or @SAMPLE@

* End List


h2. @Observations for DataItem with representation of TIME_SERIES@

A @DataItem@ with @TIME_SERIES@ @representation@ *MUST* have a @category@ of @SAMPLE@. 

A _Time Series_ _observation_ *MUST* have a @sampleCount@ attribute.

_Time Series_ _observation_ *MUST* report multiple values at fixed intervals in a single _observation_. At minimum, one of @DataItem@ or _observation_ *MUST* specify the @sampleRate@ in _hertz_ (values/second); fractional rates are permitted. When the _observation_ and the @DataItem@ specify the @sampleRate@, the _observation_ @sampleRate@ supersedes the @DataItem@.

The _observation_ *MUST* set the @timestamp@ to the time the last value was observed. The @duration@ *MAY* indicate the time interval from the first to the last value in the series.

In _XML_, the format of the _Time Series_ _observation_ *MUST* be space-separated floating-point numbers.

h2. @Observations for DataItem with representation of DISCRETE (DEPRECATED)@

_MTConnect_ Version 1.5 replaced @representation@ @DISCRETE@ with a @discrete@ _attribute_ for @DataItem@.

@DISCRETE@ *MUST* only be used with a @DataItem@ with a @category@ of @EVENT@.

Each occurrence of the _observation_ *MAY* have the same value as the previous occurrence, and *MUST NOT* suppress duplicates.

Examples of @DISCRETE@ information as follows: A @PartCount@ reporting the completion of each part using a 1 to indicate completion of a single part, a @Message@ that occurs each time a door opens. 


h2. @Observations for DataItem with representation of DATA_SET@

A @DataItem@ with @DATA_SET@ @representation@ *MUST* have a @category@ of @SAMPLE@ or @EVENT@. 

A _Data Set_ _observation_ *MUST* have a @count@ attribute.

_Data Set_ _observation_ reports multiple values as a set of _key-value pairs_ where each _key_ *MUST* be unique. The representation of the _key-value pair_ in _XML_ is an @Entry@. The value of each @Entry@ *MUST* have the same constraints and format as the _observation_ defined for the @VALUE@ @representation@ for the @DataItem@ @type@. 

The meaning of each @Entry@ *MAY* be provided as the @DataItem@ @EntryDefinition@.

The value provided for @key@ *MUST* be unique in a set of @Entry@ elements.@
@
The value provided for @key@ *MUST* be a XML NMTOKEN type.|1|
|@removed@|Boolean removal indicator of a _key-value pair_ that *MUST* be @true@ or @false@.@
@
@true@ indicates the @Entry@ is removed.@
@
@false@ (default) indicates the @Entry@ is present.|0..1|


h3. @Constraints for Entry Values@

The value of each @Entry@ *MUST* have the same restrictions as the value of an _observation_ with @representaton@ of @VALUE@.

An @Entry@ *MAY* be further constrained by the @DataItem@ definition (see {cite:Part 2}), for example a @VariableDataSet@ having a string value *MAY* have a floating-point @Temperature@ value. A restriction *MUST NOT* be broadened or removed, for example, the value "READY" *MUST NOT* occur with a @TemperatureDataSet@ constrained to floating-point numbers.

The {cite:Part 2} @DataItem@ @Definition@ *MAY* provide the @type@ and @units@ of an @Entry@ for a @key@.


h2. @Management of Data Set Observations@

An _Agent_ *MUST* maintain the current state of the _Data Set_ as described in {cite:Part 1: Management of Streaming Data Storage}.

One or more _key-value pairs_ *MAY* be added, removed, or changed in an _observation_. An _Agent_ *MUST* publish the changes to one or more _key-value pairs_ as a single _observation_. An _Agent_ *MUST* indicate the removal of a _key-value pair_ from a _Data Set_ using the @removed@ attribute equal @true@.

When the @DataItem@ @discrete@ attribute is @false@ or is not present, an _Agent_ in response to a _sample request_ *MUST* only publish the changed _key-value pair_ since the previous state of the _Data Set_.

When the @DataItem@ @discrete@ attribute is @true@, an _Agent_, in response to a _sample request_, *MUST* report all _key-value pairs_ ignoring the state of the _Data Set_.

When an _Agent_ responds to a _Current Request_, the _response document_ *MUST* include the full set of _key-value pairs_. If the _Current Request_ includes an @at@ _query parameter_, the _Agent_ *MUST* provide the set of _key-value pairs_ at the  _sequence number_.

When an _observation_ _reset_ occurs, the _Data Set_ *MUST* remove all _key-value pairs_ making the set empty. The _observation_ *MAY* simultaneously populate the _Data Set_ with new _key-value pairs_. The previous entries *MUST NOT* be included and *MUST NOT* have @removed@ attribute equal @true@.

When the _observation_ is @UNAVAILABLE@ the _Data Set_ *MUST* remove all _key-value pairs_ making the set empty.


h2. @Observations for DataItem with representation of TABLE@

A @Table@ represents two-dimensional sets of _key-value pairs_ where the @Entry@ represents rows containing sets of _key-value pairs_ given by @Cell@ s. The @Table@ has the same behavior as the _Data Set_ {ref:Data Set} for change tracking, clearing, and history. When an @Entry@ changes. All @Cells@ update at the same time; they are not tracked separately like @Entry@.

The meaning of each @Entry@ and @Cell@ *MAY* be provided as the @DataItem@ @EntryDefinition@ and @CellDefinition@.

The @Entry@ @key@ attribute *MUST* be the unique identity of the @Entry@ within an _observation_. The @Cell@ @key@ attribute *MUST* be the unique identity of the @Cell@ within an @Entry@.

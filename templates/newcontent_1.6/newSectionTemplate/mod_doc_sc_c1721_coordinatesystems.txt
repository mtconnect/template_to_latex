h2. @CoordinateSystem@

A @CoordinateSystem@ is a reference system that associates a unique set of n parameters with each point in an n-dimensional space. {ref:ISO 10303-218:2004}

h3. @Attributes for CoordinateSystem@

{table:Attributes for CoordinateSystem} lists the attributes defined to provide information for a @CoordinateSystem@ element.

* Table: @Attributes for CoordinateSystem@

|_.Attribute|_.Description|_.Occurrence|
|@id@|The unique identifier for this element.|1|
|@name@|The name of the coordinate system.@
@
If more than one @CoordinateSystem@ elements have the same @type@ for the same @Component@, then the name attribute *MUST* be provided. Otherwise, the @name@ attribute is optional.@
@
@name@ provides as an additional human-readable identifier in addition to the @id@.|0..1|
|@nativeName@|The manufacturer's name or users name for the coordinate system.|0..1|
|@parentIdRef@|A pointer to the @id@ attribute of the parent @CoordinateSystem@.|0..1|
|@type@|The type of coordinate system.|1|

h4. @CoordinateSystem types@

{table:CoordinateSystem types} defines the various types of coordinate systems.

* Table: @CoordinateSystem types@

@
For non-robotic devices, stationary coordinate system referenced to earth, which is independent of the motion of a piece of equipment.|
|@BASE@|coordinate system referenced to the base mounting surface. {ref:ISO 9787:2013}@
@
A base mounting surface is a connection surface between the arm and its supporting structure.{ref:ISO 9787:2013}@
@
For non-robotic devices, it is the connection surface between the device and its supporting structure.|
|@OBJECT@|coordinate system referenced to the object. {ref:ISO 9787:2013}|
